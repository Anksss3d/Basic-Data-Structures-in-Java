# Basic-Data-Structures-in-Java
All Basic data structures implemented using Java.
This repository contains following data structures implementations in separate java modules.
  1. Arrays
    - Linear Arrays
    - 2-dimensional Arrays
  2. Linked Lists
    a. Single Linear Linked List
    b. Single Circular Linked List
    c. Double Linear Linked List
    d. Double Circular Linked List
  3. Stack
    a. Stack using Arrays
    b. Stack using Linked List
  4. Queue
    a. Queue using Array
    b. Circular Queue using Array
    c. Queue using Linked List
    
All above data structures are implemented in best time complexity possible. 
Every data structure has all required functions to create, manipulate, traverse and delete the data structure.
User can manipulate the function, change the return type according to requirement.
The main class is provided where all data structures are called in separate functions. Hence, there one can easily check and understand the functionality of the data structure.
